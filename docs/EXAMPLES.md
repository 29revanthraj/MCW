# Examples and Demos

We aim to share our data in a format very close to the KITTI dataset to make it easy to use for researchers.
Thus, many open source tool designed for KITTI (e.g. data loaders, visualizations, detection libraries) should be directly applicable to the VoD dataset with no or minimal changes.

Nevertheless, we provide a python based development kit and a handful of examples of its usage in the form of jupyter notebooks for your convenience.

## Introduction to the data and the concept of frames
This example shows how to load the different types of data belonging to a single frame, and exaplains what do they represent using 3D plots.

## Transformations and localization
This example shows how to load and use the transformations between different frames,e.g. sensors and world coordinates.
It also directly demonstrates how to plot the vehicle's location on a map.

## 2D visualization
This example shows how to take a frame and visualize its image with its pointclouds (radar and/or LiDAR), annotations overlaid.
